## Description

- The Quiz API serves the purpose of creating, retrieving, and checking quiz-related information. It utilizes GraphQL as its query language and TypeORM as the Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library for database interactions.

- I chose the postgres relational database and designed the following data schema:

    ![](dataModel.png)

- Qustion types

    - TYPE_1 - Single Correct Answer

    - TYPE_2 - Multiple Correct Answers

    - TYPE_3 - Sorting

    - TYPE_4 - Plain Text Answer

- Quizzes will only store title. Questions will only store quiz id, question type which I presented and of course queston content. Answers will only store question id, answer content and two optional fields: is_correct to single and multiple correct answers and priority for sorting question type, plain text answer does not need these fields


## How to use API

- Creating new quiz - create and return new quiz

    ![](screenshots/creatingQuiz.png)

- Find all quizzes - return all available quizzes

    ![](screenshots/findAllQuizzes.png)

- Find full questions - return full questions for the specific quiz

    ![](screenshots/findFullQuestions.png)

- Check student answers - student can prvoide answers and we can chose which information we want to see e.g. student result, perecntage student/correct answers
